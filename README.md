# JSON HJOIN Example Implemented in CP4D v3

There's a great DataStage tutorial that shows you how to use the Hierarchical Data capability that you can follow here: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZJPZ_11.7.0/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.ds.stages.xml.core.usage.doc/topics/example2_parent_composingjsondata.html

However if you're looking to do this in CP4D v3 things are slightly different as it appears that there is no chunking capability. This actually makes things a bit simpler as you no longer need the first two JSON Composer steps in the tutorial.

Import my .isx file if you'd like to fast track and see the finished code.
